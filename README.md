## Abstract
Nowadays Excel files carry most of the datasets created for various usages. Extracting
information from these Excel file is an important task. So to fulfill theses purposes clustering
regression is applied to the Excel File. Prediction of attributes in these Excel files is important
for some activities. Regression techniques are most widely used for prediction task where
relationship between the independent variable and dependent variable is identified. The
accuracy of the regression techniques for prediction can be improved if clustering can be used
along with regression. Clustering along with regression will ensure the more accurate curve
fitting between the dependent and independent variables. The objective of this proposed work
is to find an optimum number of clusters in which original dataset should be clustered to
ensure less prediction errors for estimating the value of dependent variable. The proposed
project consists of four major stages, first of all data preparation is carried by extracting data
from Excel file; in the second stage, clustering is used to group the similar type of data, in
third stage regression techniques are applied over these groups (clusters) to predict the
dependent variable value from individual clusters, and the last stage task concludes with
finding the cluster count for which minimum error is estimated. The output (clusters) are
generated in Excel file format for further uses.
